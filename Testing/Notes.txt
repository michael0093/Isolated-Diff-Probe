Changes to the rev A PCB:
 * 1nF Y1 capacitor between isolated GNDs avoids some weird noise 'glitches' at higher frequencies mainly on the AMC3302 (other values probably fine)
 * 1M bias resistors from each input to GND avoid clipping of tops of sine, probably due to bias
 * Adding 47uF HXD at input or output caps didn't help.
 * Opamp resistors change from 10k to 4k7 and the capacitors from 1nF to 100pF to increase frequency response
 * Actual opamp is OPA2376 (thats what was on hand)
 
At 5V input, typ current draw is 30mA

Shunt diff probe AMC3302:
 Fitted with 0R01 shunt LRMAM1206-R01FT5 (Element14 # 207-9442)
 Minimum recommended current with 10mR shunt = 3mA which results in about 1.2mV at output.
 Measured 3dB point (100mA on 0R01 shunt) = 220 kHz but see note below
 At higher freq the noise beats with the measurement so you get weirdness (note: adding 47uF or bigger Y1 doesnt help)
 Noise at output with shorted input much worse so dont do that (?)
 
Voltage diff probe AMC3330:
 470K on physical sample is the Resistor Today part
 Measured 3dB point (1Vpp input) = 330kHz
 The weirdness noted for AMC3302 is also present for AMC3330 if you have a small signal
