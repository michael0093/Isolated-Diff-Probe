Changes to the rev A PCB to make rev A1:
 * 1nF Y1 capacitor between isolated GNDs avoids some weird noise 'glitches' at higher frequencies mainly on the AMC3302 (other values probably fine)
 * 1M bias resistors from each input to GND avoid clipping of tops of sine, probably due to bias
 * Adding 47uF HXD at input or output caps didn't help.
 * Opamp resistors change from 10k to 4k7 and the capacitors from 1nF to 100pF to increase frequency response
 * Actual opamp is OPA2376 (thats what was on hand)
 
At 5V input, typ current draw is 30mA

Shunt diff probe AMC3302:
 Fitted with 0R01 shunt LRMAM1206-R01FT5 (Element14 # 207-9442)
 Minimum recommended current with 10mR shunt = 3mA which results in about 1.2mV at output.
 Measured 3dB point (100mA on 0R01 shunt) = 220 kHz but see note below
 At higher freq the noise beats with the measurement so you get weirdness (note: adding 47uF or bigger Y1 doesnt help)
 Noise at output with shorted input much worse so dont do that (?)
 
Voltage diff probe AMC3330:
 470K on physical sample is the Resistor Today part
 Measured 3dB point (1Vpp input) = 330kHz
 The weirdness noted for AMC3302 is also present for AMC3330 if you have a small signal
    -- this root cause has been solved in rev B1 see below.


*******************************
Updates for Rev B August 2025: All of these except the diode and 1k shunt input resistors have been applied as mods for the rev A2 design

 * Change C12 and C15 to 33pF to improve frequency response
 * Updated input filter and bias, adding capacitance to HGND is what solves the "weirdness" observed before and negates the need for the Y1 cap. The Y1 cap is detremental to the higher voltage input options (waveform distortion)
   * For AMC3300 voltage probe, input filter/bias is: R34.R33=1M. C11,C20,C21=33pF. Added R35,R36 to reduce freq of shunt input (else >>1M target)
   * For AMC3302 current probe, input filter/bias is: R34.R33=100k. C11,C20,C21=3.3nF
 * Added anti-parallel diode at power input for crude polarity protection
 * For AMC3300 with shunt, added series R35,R36=1k and C1=100nF to reduce fc

Rev B1 AMC3302 measured frequency response with sine:
With 100pF in opamp circuit:
    large signal on 1R shunt:   4.76V at 1kHz --> 3.36V at 210kHz
    small signal on 0R01 shunt: 388mV at 1kHz --> 274mV at 230kHz
After changing to 33pF in opamp circuit: 1R shunt is about 280kHz -- see charts in folder.
